# Future Plan

## Surge Pricing
I don't think I would have to change anything but maybe that's just me being optimistic. I just think I would have to add more API methods. Maybe I would have to add a value to the users table.

## Future Scheduling
I would probably add a new table holding the order of who scheduled their ride first, and then add a bunch of API methods like a queue for First in First Out
